# Homework-1-Bootcamp-Kickstart
## Background

Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success.  Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.

Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt too discover some trick for finding success.  I have been tasked with organizing and analyzing a database of 4,000 past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.


## Findings

  1. Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaign?
  
      1. After analyzing the data,  I found that there are three parent categories that experience a success rate of greater than 50%.  The          categories are:  Music (77.1%), Theater (60.2%), and Film & Video (57.7%).

      1. Each of the Parent Categories above have their successful and unsuccessful categories.
      
         1. Most of the subcategories of the Music group are successful with the exception of jazz and faith music which are unsuccessful               at 100% and 67% failure rates, respectively.

         1.  Plays are the only successful subcategory of the theater parent group with a 65.1%.  Musicals and spaces have under 50%                    probability of success.

         1. In the film & video category, it appears to be either sink or swim.  Documentaries, shorts, and television projects were                   successful at a 100% rate. While the other subcategory projects all failed or were cancelled.
